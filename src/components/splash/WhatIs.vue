        Even the best planned meetings often don't cover the agenda they were planned for. There are countless reasons, but it more often comes down to have little or no meeting discipline. Most often this because no one is aware of the rules or everyone has their own idea of the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>SOXPROX helps get the most value from your meetings.</strong> It helps you plan, organize and run your meetings in a lean and disciplined fashion, making sure everyone in the meeting is aware of the overall agenda, the current agenda item, and time left for remaining agenda items.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only will meetings run more smoothly, but as SOXPROX tracks and chases actions for you, saving you time and delivering even more value to your future meetings.
